Based on the ultraviolet system, Interstellar is a proxy developed by the macbooksuck development team.

To those who were intrested to find out just what this was it is a proxy that is in creation allowing you to play url games unrestricted. The proxy includes apps like amazon luna, geforce now and chatgpt allowing you to play games like fortnite right off the proxy.
